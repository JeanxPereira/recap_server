# Resurrection Capsule Server
The server application of the Resurrection Capsule project, which can be used to mimic the functionalities of the original servers used to play Darkspore, including HTTP APIs, Blaze, RakNet and SporeNet.

This server is a part of the Resurrection Capsule project, and will not work if used on its own. In order to get all the needed parts of the project, check our [central repository](https://github.com/vitor251093/resurrection-capsule).
